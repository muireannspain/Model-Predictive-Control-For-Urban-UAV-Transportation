# Advanced-Control-Design-Final-Project
To solve current challenges with dense traffic in the Bay Area, our team strives to redefine public transportation by utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Using Model Predictive Control (MPC), this project simulates an autonomous quadcopter flying in 3-D space between Berkeley, San Francisco, and Palo Alto. Specifically, the UAV aims to travel between destinations as quickly as possible while minimizing input power for a predefined trajectory. Furthermore, the UAV is constrained to fly within a virtual tube, limiting the UAVâ€™s displacement from the reference trajectory. A link to the MATLAB code is provided below in the appendix.
